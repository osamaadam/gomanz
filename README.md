To build for win32:

```sh
GOARCH=386 go build
```

> This project isn't intended for public use, but rather a very specific use case which I happen to need in my period of military service.
> If you're new to Go, this code could be a quick reference to building CLIs with GO.
> There aren't that many code references for building a Microsoft Access API with GO, so this is my attempt.
> Hopefully I won't be commiting credentials to this code base _fingers crossed_
